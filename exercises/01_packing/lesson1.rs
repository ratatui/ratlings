// Ratatui and his fellow chef friends are going on an adventure!
//
// After years of working away, spending long hours in the kitchen, and late nights
// coming up with the perfect recipes, they've earned some much needed rest and
// relaxation. But this hairy bunch isn't headed to a summer home, nor a nice,
// relaxing beach. No, _they're going camping_!
//
// Only... there's one problem. Ratatui has never gone camping before. It's
// time to pack, but he has no idea what he needs to bring, or how to organize
// his bag! Wait a second—he doesn't even have a bag! Can you help him find one?
//
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything you see in a Ratatui app is a widget drawn into an area of the
// frame. `render_widget` is the call that puts one there, and `frame.area()`
// is the whole terminal. A `Block` is the simplest useful widget there is: a
// box, optionally with borders and a title.

use ratatui::{DefaultTerminal, Frame, widgets::Block};
use std::io::IsTerminal;

pub fn render(frame: &mut Frame) {
    // TODO: Ratatui is rendering a block, but a plain `Block::new()` draws
    // nothing at all — run it and you get an empty screen. Give him a bag he
    // can actually see: a block with borders, titled " pack ".
    //
    // Docs: https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/widgets/struct.Block.html
    frame.render_widget(Block::new(), frame.area());
}

// Hi Ratatui student!
// Everything below this is just scaffolding.
// It opens the terminal, draws `render` until a key is pressed,
// and checks your work. It is the same in every lesson and you never
// need to edit it. Your work is above this line.
